# Cleanup Summary - Focused Urology Workflow

## ‚úÖ What Was Cleaned Up

### **Files Deleted (Bloat Removed):**
```
‚ùå differentials/clinical_context.py
‚ùå differentials/clinical_education.py
‚ùå differentials/pharmacy_pathways.py
‚ùå differentials/pain_conditions.py

```

### **Tools Removed from tools.py:**
```
‚ùå calculator_tool (old throat calculator - not urology)
‚ùå calculate_pain_conditions (MSK pain - not urology)
‚ùå check_pharmacy_pathway (UK pharmacy - not relevant)
‚ùå get_clinical_guidance (unused complexity)
‚ùå get_next_safety_question (replaced with ONE question)
‚ùå record_safety_question_asked (not needed)
‚ùå search_urology_symptoms (too complex for now)
‚ùå record_symptoms (LLM can do this)
‚ùå store_patient_info (LLM can do this)
‚ùå record_medical_history (LLM can do this)
‚ùå record_patient_concerns (LLM can do this)
```

## ‚úÖ New Clean Architecture

### **Core Tools (tools_clean.py):**

#### **1. Red Flag Safety (ONE Question):**
```python
get_red_flag_checklist()
‚Üí Returns complete list of 7 red flags
‚Üí PI Agent asks: "Do you have ANY of the following? If so, which ones?"
   - Blood in urine
   - Severe sudden pain
   - Fever/chills
   - Unable to urinate
   - Weight loss
   - Family history prostate cancer
   - Previous kidney stones

record_red_flag_answers(reported_flags=["blood_in_urine", "fever"])
‚Üí Records which red flags present
‚Üí Updates context with relevant data for calculator
‚Üí Returns urgency level (A&E / GP / Continue)
```

#### **2. Urology Calculator (Core Workflow):**
```python
build_probability_graph()
‚Üí Calls urology_calculator.py with Bayesian math
‚Üí Returns probabilities, graph, entropy, recommendations

find_strategic_questions(max_questions=3)
‚Üí Runs FindPivots algorithm
‚Üí Returns top questions ranked by information gain

update_graph_with_answer(symptom_id, value)
‚Üí Updates probabilities with new answer
‚Üí Recalculates entropy
‚Üí Returns continue_questioning=True/False
```

#### **3. Final Output:**
```python
generate_patient_action_plan()
‚Üí Final recommendations, investigations, next steps

generate_gp_referral_letter()
‚Üí Formal letter with summary
```

#### **4. Treatment Pathways (Separate Agent):**
```python
score_procedural_pathway()
‚Üí Biopsy indication, HIFU eligibility
‚Üí Used AFTER diagnosis by Treatment Agent
```

## ‚úÖ Updated Agent Flow

### **1. Host Agent:**
**Job:** Initial greeting, capture age/gender/chief complaint
**Tools:** NONE (just conversation)
**Output:** Handoff to PI Agent

```
Host: "Hello! Welcome to urology consultation. What brings you in today?"
Patient: "I'm 62, struggling with weak urine flow"
Host: [Stores age=62, chief_complaint="weak urine flow", adds "weak_stream" to symptoms]
Host: "Let me bring in our specialist..."
‚Üí Handoff to PI
```

### **2. PI Agent (Safety Gatekeeper):**
**Job:** Ask ONE red flag question
**Tools:** 
- `get_red_flag_checklist()` 
- `record_red_flag_answers()`

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Call get_red_flag_checklist()
Step 2: Ask patient: "Do you have ANY of the following? If so, which ones?"
        [Lists all 7 red flags]
Step 3: Patient answers (e.g., "None" or "I have family history")
Step 4: Call record_red_flag_answers(reported_flags=["family_history_prostate_cancer"])
Step 5: Check response:
        - If urgent_action_needed=True: STOP, advise A&E
        - If False: "Thank you, let me bring in our diagnostic specialist"
        ‚Üí Handoff to Graph Agent
```

### **3. Graph Reasoning Agent:**
**Job:** Entropy-driven diagnostic questioning
**Tools:**
- `build_probability_graph()`
- `find_strategic_questions()`
- `update_graph_with_answer()`

**Process:**
```
Loop:
  1. Call build_probability_graph()
     ‚Üí Returns: probabilities, entropy, top differentials
  
  2. If entropy < 0.05: DONE, handoff to Recommendation Agent
  
  3. Call find_strategic_questions()
     ‚Üí Returns: top 1-3 questions ranked by info gain
  
  4. Ask patient best question (ONE at a time)
  
  5. Patient answers
  
  6. Call update_graph_with_answer(symptom_id, value)
     ‚Üí Returns: new_entropy, continue_questioning
  
  7. If continue_questioning=False: DONE
     Else: Loop back to step 2

Final: "Thank you, I have enough information. Let me bring in our recommendation specialist."
       ‚Üí Handoff to Recommendation Agent
```

### **4. Recommendation Agent:**
**Job:** Final recommendations, education, action plan
**Tools:**
- `generate_patient_action_plan()`
- `generate_gp_referral_letter()`

**Process:**
```
1. Review final probabilities from context
2. Call generate_patient_action_plan()
3. Present to patient:
   - Most likely diagnosis
   - Recommended investigations
   - Management options
   - Red flags to watch for
4. Offer: "Would you like a GP letter?"
   If yes: Call generate_gp_referral_letter()
```

## ‚úÖ Key Simplifications

### **Red Flags: 5 questions ‚Üí 1 question**
**Before:**
```
PI: "Do you have blood in urine?" 
Patient: "No"
PI: "Severe pain?"
Patient: "No"
PI: "Fever?"
Patient: "No"
PI: "Weight loss?"
Patient: "No"
PI: "Family history?"
Patient: "Yes, my dad"
[5 separate exchanges]
```

**After:**
```
PI: "Do you have ANY of these? Blood in urine, severe pain, fever, unable to urinate, weight loss, family history of prostate cancer, previous kidney stones?"
Patient: "Yes, my dad had prostate cancer"
[1 exchange]
```

### **Context Management: LLM does it**
**Before:** 
- 5 separate tools to record symptoms, demographics, history, concerns
- Agents had to remember to call each tool
- Easy to forget and lose data

**After:**
- LLM directly updates context (it's smart enough!)
- Tools only for calculations and red flags
- Simpler = fewer errors

### **Workflow: Laser focused**
**Before:** 
- 17 tools to choose from
- Agents confused about which tool when
- Pain conditions, pharmacy pathways, education modules

**After:**
- 8 tools total (3 for safety, 3 for calculator, 2 for output)
- Each agent has 1-3 tools max
- Clear purpose for each tool

## ‚úÖ What to Test

### **Test Case 1: No Red Flags**
```
Patient: 62M, weak stream, nocturia 3x/night, gradual onset
Expected: BPH ~85%, smooth workflow, 3-4 diagnostic questions
```

### **Test Case 2: Red Flag Present (Not Urgent)**
```
Patient: 55M, weak stream, father had prostate cancer
Expected: Family history noted, BPH prior adjusted to 20%, continue
```

### **Test Case 3: Red Flag URGENT**
```
Patient: 70M, unable to urinate at all, severe pain
Expected: PI Agent says "A&E immediately", STOP diagnostic questions
```

### **Test Case 4: Multiple Symptoms**
```
Patient: 32F, burning on urination, urgency, sudden onset yesterday
Expected: UTI ~90%, quick diagnosis (2-3 questions)
```

## ‚úÖ Files to Use

### **Keep:**
```
‚úÖ tools_clean.py (new minimal tools)
‚úÖ differentials/urology_calculator.py (Bayesian calculator)
‚úÖ differentials/graph_engine.py (FindPivots)
‚úÖ differentials/graph_builder.py (helpers)
‚úÖ procedural/procedural_calculators.py (Treatment Agent tools)
‚úÖ main.py (agent definitions)
‚úÖ api.py (orchestration)
```

### **Archive/Delete:**
```
‚ùå tools.py (replace with tools_clean.py)
‚ùå All deleted files already moved to archive
```

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Rename files:**
   ```bash
   mv tools.py tools_old.py
   mv tools_clean.py tools.py
   ```

2. **Update main.py imports:**
   ```python
   from tools import (
       get_red_flag_checklist,
       record_red_flag_answers,
       build_probability_graph,
       find_strategic_questions,
       update_graph_with_answer,
       generate_patient_action_plan,
       generate_gp_referral_letter,
       score_procedural_pathway
   )
   ```

3. **Update PI Agent instructions:**
   - Remove multiple safety question loop
   - Add ONE red flag question workflow
   - Simplify handoff logic

4. **Test with real cases**
