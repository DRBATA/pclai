## 🎯 Architecture Overview

```
User → Host Agent → PI Agent → Graph Reasoning Agent → Final Analysis
```

### **Agent Flow:**

1. **Host Agent** (Empathetic Opening)
   - Disclaimer
   - Open questions (Golden Minute)
   - Records: symptoms, age, gender, medical history
   - Tools: `store_patient_info`, `record_symptoms`, `record_medical_history`
   - Hands off to: **PI Agent**

2. **PI Agent** (Safety & Triage)
   - Safety check with `check_safety_concerns` (silent if clear)
   - Gets clinical context with `get_clinical_guidance`
   - Brief summary to patient
   - Hands off to: **Graph Reasoning Agent**

3. **Graph Reasoning Agent** (Adaptive Systematic Questioning)
   - Builds probability graph from all calculators
   - Uses **FindPivots algorithm** to identify informational hub nodes
   - Asks SIQORSTAA questions one at a time
   - Updates graph and propagates probabilities after each answer
   - Stops when entropy < 0.2 OR 10 questions asked
   - Provides final differential diagnosis

## 🧠 Core Algorithms

### **1. FindPivots Algorithm**
**File:** `differentials/graph_engine.py`

**Purpose:** Identifies the most strategically valuable nodes (symptoms) to query

**How it works:**
1. Takes known symptoms as "seed set"
2. Propagates outward k steps through the graph
3. Tracks reachable nodes within bound B
4. Returns:
   - **Pivots**: Strategic nodes that connect multiple subgraphs
   - **Working set**: All relevant nodes for computation

**Result:** Reduces entropy calculation from O(N²) to O(k·S)

### **2. Entropy-Based Question Selection**
**File:** `differentials/graph_engine.py`

**Purpose:** Choose the next question that maximizes information gain

**Formula:**
```python
Information Gain = Current Entropy - Expected Entropy After Answer
```

**Shannon Entropy:**
```python
H(p) = -p·log₂(p) - (1-p)·log₂(1-p)
```

- Entropy = 1 at p=0.5 (maximum uncertainty)
- Entropy = 0 at p=0 or p=1 (certainty)

**Process:**
1. For each unknown symptom in working set:
   - Calculate hypothetical probabilities if answer is yes/no
   - Calculate expected entropy after answer
   - Compute information gain
2. Return symptom with highest gain

### **3. Graph Propagation**
**File:** `differentials/graph_engine.py`

**Purpose:** Update disease probabilities when new symptom information arrives

**Algorithm:**
```python
For each edge from updated_symptom to disease:
    delta = edge_weight × symptom_value
    new_prob = current_prob + delta - 0.5
    disease.probability = clamp(new_prob, 0, 1)
```

## 📊 Probability Graph Structure

### **Nodes:**
- **Symptom nodes**: 
  - `type: "symptom"`
  - `value: null | 0-1` (null = unknown, 0-1 = present/absent or severity)
  
- **Disease nodes**:
  - `type: "disease"`
  - `probability: 0-1` (likelihood of this condition)

### **Edges:**
- **From**: Symptom node
- **To**: Disease node
- **Weight**: Strength of relationship (0-1)

**Example:**
```
fever (value=1) --[weight=0.7]--> strep_throat (prob=0.5)
                                     ↓ (after propagation)
                                  prob=0.65
```

## 🎮 Usage Example

### **Scenario: Sore throat presentation**

```python
# 1. Host Agent collects narrative
User: "I have a sore throat for 3 days"
Host: record_symptoms("sore throat")
Host: "How old are you?"
User: "28"
Host: store_patient_info(age=28, gender="Female")

# 2. PI Agent checks safety
PI: check_safety_concerns("sore throat", age=28)
    → No red flags
PI: get_clinical_guidance("sore throat")
    → Returns: bacterial vs viral questions

# 3. Graph Reasoning Agent builds graph
Graph: build_probability_graph()
    → Creates nodes for strep, viral, flu, cold
    → Populates "sore_throat" node with value=1
    → Initial entropy: 0.85

# 4. FindPivots identifies strategic questions
Graph: find_strategic_questions()
    → Pivots: ["lymph_nodes", "tonsil_swelling", "no_cough"]
    → Top question: "Do you have swollen tender glands in your neck?"

# 5. Adaptive questioning loop
User: "Yes, very tender"
Graph: update_graph_with_answer("lymph_nodes", value=1)
    → Strep prob: 0.5 → 0.72
    → New entropy: 0.61

Graph: find_strategic_questions()
    → Next: "Do you have any cough?"

User: "No cough"
Graph: update_graph_with_answer("no_cough", value=1)
    → Strep prob: 0.72 → 0.85
    → New entropy: 0.18 ← STOP (< 0.2)

# 6. Final analysis
Graph: Top differentials:
    1. Strep Throat: 85% probability
    2. Viral Pharyngitis: 12%
    3. Influenza: 3%
