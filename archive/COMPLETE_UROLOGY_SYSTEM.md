# Complete Urology System with Procedural Pathways

## ✅ **COMPLETE! Maximum Output Urology Pathway**

---

## **What You Have Now:**

### **1. 4-Agent Consultation Flow**
```
User → Host → PI → Graph Reasoning → Recommendation → Surgeon Handoff
```

### **2. Full Urology Support**
- 14 urological conditions in probability graph
- Systematic SIQORSTAA questioning
- Patient concerns & goals tracking

### **3. Procedural Decision System**
- **YAML-based clinical graphs** (versioned, auditable)
- **Deterministic scoring** (evidence-based, explainable)
- **Intelligent routing** (Nurse/PA/Doctor based on complexity)
- **Surgeon handoff** with formal letter

---

## **Complete System Architecture:**

### **Clinical Graph (YAML - Versioned in Git)**

```
clinical_graph/
├── biopsy.yaml       # MRI-fusion biopsy indications
└── hifu.yaml         # Focal HIFU eligibility
```

**Features:**
- Likelihood ratios (LR) for each clinical feature
- Evidence-based weights (EAU, NICE, JAMA)
- Contraindication rules
- Decision thresholds

**Example:**
```yaml
supports:
  - feature: PIRADS
    threshold: 4
    lr: 3.2
    weight: 1.3
    evidence: EAU-2025-PI-RADS
```

---

### **Procedural Scorer (Python - Deterministic)**

**File:** `procedural/scorer.py`

**What it does:**
1. Loads YAML clinical graphs
2. Scores patient on features (PIRADS, PSAD, PSAV, lesion size, etc.)
3. Calculates soft score: `log10(LR product) + weight sum + output weight`
4. Routes to appropriate role based on complexity:
   - **Complexity ≤ 0.5**: Prostate Specialist Nurse (no signoff)
   - **Complexity < 1.2**: Physician Associate (MD signoff required)
   - **Complexity ≥ 1.2**: Urologist Doctor (full review)
5. Returns evidence-based plan with next steps

**Example output:**
```python
{
  "assigned_role": "Urologist_Doctor",
  "signoff_required": True,
  "complexity": 1.72,
  "biopsy": {
    "score": 1.72,
    "interpretation": "discuss MRI-fusion biopsy",
    "evidence_hits": [
      {"feature": "PIRADS", "patient_value": 4, "threshold": 4, "lr": 3.2, "evidence": "EAU-2025-PI-RADS"},
      {"feature": "PSAD", "patient_value": 0.18, "threshold": 0.15, "lr": 2.5, "evidence": "NICE-NG131-2024"}
    ],
    "consent_template": "Consent_Biopsy@v1.1"
  },
  "hifu": {
    "score": 0.93,
    "contraindicated": False,
    "interpretation": "not a focal candidate / consider alternatives"
  },
  "next_steps": [
    "Review calculator outputs and evidence",
    "Conduct consent discussion with patient",
    "Confirm procedural pathway and sign off"
  ]
}
```

### **Agent Workflow:**

#### **1. Host Agent**
- Gathers patient story
- Records: symptoms, demographics, **concerns, goals**
- Example: "I'm worried about prostate cancer, want to avoid surgery"

#### **2. PI Agent**
- Safety check
- Clinical context
- Quick handoff to Graph Reasoning

#### **3. Graph Reasoning Agent**
- Builds probability graph (UTI, BPH, prostate cancer, etc.)
- Asks strategic questions (FindPivots algorithm)
- Stops when entropy < 0.2 or 10 questions
- Hands off to Recommendation

#### **4. Recommendation Agent**
**THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS:**

1. **Reviews all context** (concerns, goals, differentials)

2. **Addresses patient concerns with education**
   - Uses `get_patient_education("PSA")` to explain concepts
   - E.g., "normal PSA doesn't rule out cancer"

3. **Generates action plan**
   - Differentials, investigations, management

4. **IF procedural features available:**
   - Calls `score_procedural_pathway(pirads=4, psad=0.18, ...)`
   - Gets scored recommendation for biopsy/HIFU
   - Routes to appropriate specialist
   - Explains evidence: "Based on your PI-RADS 4 and PSA density 0.18..."

5. **Generates surgeon handoff letter**
   - Formal GP/specialist letter
   - Includes procedural scores and routing
   - Patient can share with urologist

## **Example Complete Flow:**

### **User:** "I have urinary symptoms and my PSA is elevated"

### **Host:**
- "Tell me more..." → Records symptoms
- "Any concerns?" → "Worried about prostate cancer"
- "Goals?" → "Want to understand options, avoid surgery if possible"

### **PI:**
- Safety check → No red flags
- Handoff to Graph Reasoning

### **Graph Reasoning:**
- Builds graph: BPH vs prostate cancer
- Q1: "Weak stream?" → "Yes, 7/10"
- Q2: "Straining?" → "Yes"
- Q3: "Any pain?" → "No"
- → BPH 82%, Prostate Cancer 15%
- Handoff to Recommendation

### **Recommendation Agent:**

**Addresses concern about cancer:**
```
"I know you mentioned you were worried about prostate cancer. Let me address that directly.

Your symptoms strongly suggest Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) - 82% probability. However, given your elevated PSA, we do need to investigate further.

Here's what you need to know about PSA: [uses get_patient_education]
- 15% of men with NORMAL PSA have prostate cancer
- Your elevated PSA could be from BPH, infection, or cancer
- We should test for infection first, then reassess
```

**Addresses surgery concern:**
```
"You mentioned wanting to avoid surgery. Good news - 60-80% of men with BPH improve with medications alone:
- Alpha-blockers work within days
- 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors shrink the prostate over months
- Surgery only if medications fail
```

**IF patient has had MRI:**
```
[Calls score_procedural_pathway(pirads=4, psad=0.18, psav=1.6, lesion=8, prostate_vol=55)]

"Based on your imaging results:
- PI-RADS 4 lesion (8mm)
- PSA density 0.18
- Prostate volume 55mL

You ARE a candidate for MRI-fusion biopsy.

Evidence supporting this:
- PI-RADS ≥4: Likelihood ratio 3.2 (EAU-2025 guidelines)
- PSA density ≥0.15: Likelihood ratio 2.5 (NICE-NG131-2024)

Your case has been assigned to: Urologist Doctor
Signoff required: Yes
Next steps:
1. Review calculator outputs and evidence
2. Conduct consent discussion
3. Confirm biopsy pathway and sign off

You are NOT currently a candidate for focal HIFU (score too low).
"
```

**Generates letters:**
- Action plan for patient
- GP referral letter with procedural scores

### **Test Case: Prostate Cancer Pathway**

**User inputs:**
```
"I'm having trouble urinating. My GP did a PSA test and it's 6.2. They sent me for an MRI which showed a PI-RADS 4 lesion, 8mm. I'm worried about cancer but really want to avoid surgery if possible."
```

**System should:**
1. Host captures: concern="cancer", goal="avoid surgery"
2. PI checks safety → clear
3. Graph asks SIQORSTAA questions → BPH likely
4. Recommendation:
   - Educates about PSA (normal doesn't rule out, elevated doesn't mean cancer)
   - Explains BPH medications (avoid surgery)
   - **Scores procedural pathway:**
     - Biopsy score: ~1.7 (recommend MRI-fusion)
     - HIFU score: depends on Gleason
     - Routes to: Urologist Doctor
   - Generates action plan + GP letter

---

## **What You Can Do Now:**

✅ Test complete urology consultations  
✅ Score patients for biopsy/HIFU eligibility  
✅ Route to appropriate specialist  
✅ Generate surgeon handoff letters  
✅ Explain complex topics (PSA, surgery options)  
✅ Address patient concerns and goals

}
```

### **PostgreSQL Integration (Optional):**
```sql
-- Track cases and audit trail
CREATE TABLE cases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  features JSONB,
  calc_scores JSONB,
  routing JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE TABLE case_events (
  case_id UUID REFERENCES cases,
  event_name TEXT,
  meta JSONB,

## **The Secret Sauce:**

### **Small Context Per Agent:**
Each agent does ONE thing with focused tools

### **YAML Clinical Graphs:**
Truth lives in version-controlled files, not database

### **Deterministic Scoring:**
Reproducible, explainable, auditable

### **LLM as Explainer:**
Model explains scores, doesn't make decisions

### **Complete Handoff:**
Surgeon gets evidence-based recommendation with routing
