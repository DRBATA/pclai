# Prostate Cancer Treatment Comparison Table

## Quick Reference for Patient Discussion

| Procedure | Best For | Recovery | Continence | Erectile Function | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Active Surveillance** | Low-risk, patient preference | Ongoing monitoring | N/A | N/A | NICE NG131, EAU 2025 |
| **HIFU** | Low-intermediate risk, tissue preservation | 1-2 weeks | 95%+ | 70-80% | NICE IPG756, Ahmed 2021 |
| **MRI-Fusion Biopsy** | Diagnostic (before treatment) | 24-48 hours | N/A | N/A | EAU 2025, NICE NG131 |
| **Radical Prostatectomy** | Intermediate-high risk, age <70 | 6-8 weeks | 80-95% | 50-70% | EAU 2025, Gold Standard |
| **Radiation Therapy** | Intermediate-high risk, age >70 | 1-2 weeks (treatment) | 70-80% | 60-70% | EAU 2025, Equivalent to Surgery |

## Detailed Comparison

### By Risk Group

**LOW-RISK (Gleason 3+3, PSA <10, ≤2 cores)**
```
Recommended: Active Surveillance
Alternative: HIFU (if available, patient preference)
Avoid: Surgery/Radiation (overtreatment)
```

**INTERMEDIATE-RISK (Gleason 3+4 or PSA 10-20 or >2 cores)**
```
If age <70: Surgery or Radiation
If age >70: Radiation or HIFU
Alternative: Active Surveillance (selected cases)
```

**HIGH-RISK (Gleason ≥4+3 or PSA >20 or T3-4)**
```
Recommended: Surgery + Radiation (multimodal)
Or: Radiation + Hormone therapy
Referral: Oncology for systemic therapy
```

### By Patient Priority

**Priority: Avoid Side Effects**
1. Active Surveillance (no treatment side effects)
2. HIFU (better continence/erectile function than surgery)
3. Radiation (less invasive than surgery)

**Priority: Definitive Treatment**
1. Surgery (best cancer control, permanent)
2. Radiation (excellent outcomes, non-invasive)
3. HIFU (focal therapy, less proven)

**Priority: Quick Recovery**
1. Active Surveillance (no recovery)
2. HIFU (1-2 weeks)
3. Radiation (1-2 weeks treatment, minimal downtime)
4. Surgery (6-8 weeks)

**Priority: Preserve Function**
1. HIFU (95%+ continence, 70-80% erectile function)
2. Radiation (70-80% continence, 60-70% erectile function)
3. Surgery (80-95% continence, 50-70% erectile function - varies by age/technique)

### Investigation Pathway

```
Patient Reports Symptoms
        ↓
PSA Blood Test + DRE
        ↓
If PSA elevated or abnormal DRE:
        ↓
MRI Prostate (mpMRI)
        ↓
If PI-RADS 3-5:
        ↓
MRI-Fusion Biopsy (diagnostic)
        ↓
Gleason Score Determined
        ↓
Risk Stratification (Low/Intermediate/High)
        ↓
Treatment Discussion Based on Risk + Patient Preference
```

### Timeline from Diagnosis to Treatment

| Milestone | Timeframe |
|-----------|-----------|
| Initial PSA/DRE | Week 0 |
| MRI if abnormal | Week 1-2 |
| Biopsy if PI-RADS 3-5 | Week 2-3 |
| Pathology results | Week 3-4 |
| Staging (if needed) | Week 4-6 |
| Treatment discussion | Week 6-8 |
| Treatment starts | Week 8-12 |

### Cost & Access Considerations

| Procedure | NHS Availability | Private Cost | Specialist Required |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| PSA/DRE | Routine | £50-100 | GP |
| MRI | Standard | £300-500 | Radiologist |
| Biopsy | Standard | £500-1000 | Urologist |
| Active Surveillance | Standard | Free | Urologist |
| HIFU | Limited (trials) | £8,000-15,000 | Specialized Urologist |
| Surgery | Standard | £5,000-10,000 | Urologist |
| Radiation | Standard | £3,000-8,000 | Oncologist |

### When to Refer to Specialist

**Refer to Urologist if:**
- PSA >4 ng/mL (or >2.5 if high-risk factors)
- Abnormal DRE findings
- PSA velocity rising rapidly
- Family history of prostate cancer

**Refer to Oncology if:**
- High-risk or metastatic disease
- Need for systemic therapy
- Complex treatment decisions

**Refer to Specialized HIFU Center if:**
- Patient interested in focal therapy
- Low-intermediate risk, MRI concordance
- Wants tissue-preserving approach
