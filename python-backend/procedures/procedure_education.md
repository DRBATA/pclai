# Prostate Cancer Procedures - Patient Education Guide

## MRI-Fusion Biopsy

**What it is:**
Targeted biopsy using MRI imaging to guide needle placement to suspicious areas of the prostate.

**When it's recommended:**
- PI-RADS 4-5 lesions (always requires biopsy regardless of PSA density)
- PI-RADS 3 lesions with PSA density ≥0.15
- Helps confirm diagnosis before treatment decisions

**What to expect:**
- Outpatient procedure, takes 20-30 minutes
- Local anesthesia
- Ultrasound and MRI guidance
- 10-12 tissue samples taken

**Recovery:**
- Resume normal activities: 24-48 hours
- Blood in urine/semen: Can persist 2-8 weeks (normal)
- Mild discomfort: 1-2 days
- Return to work: Next day for most

**Evidence:**
- EAU 2025 Guidelines: Recommended for PI-RADS 4-5
- NICE NG131: Standard of care for suspicious lesions
- Improves diagnostic accuracy vs. standard biopsy

## HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound)

**What it is:**
Focal therapy using ultrasound energy to destroy cancer cells in specific areas of the prostate while preserving healthy tissue.

**When it's considered:**
- Low-risk localized prostate cancer (Gleason ≤6, PSA <10)
- Some intermediate-risk cases (Gleason 3+4)
- Patient preference for tissue-preserving approach
- NOT routine - typically in specialized centers or clinical trials

**What to expect:**
- Outpatient or 1-night stay
- General or spinal anesthesia
- Procedure takes 1-2 hours
- May require temporary catheter (24-48 hours)

**Recovery:**
- Resume normal activities: 1-2 weeks
- Fatigue: May persist 6-8 weeks
- Urinary symptoms: Temporary, resolve in weeks
- Return to work: 1-2 weeks

**Important notes:**
- Oncologic benefit still being studied
- Functional benefits (continence, erectile function) better than surgery
- Best outcomes with MRI/biopsy concordance
- Requires specialized expertise

**Evidence:**
- NICE IPG756: Efficacy limited, requires special arrangements
- Ahmed 2021 (Lancet Oncology): Favorable functional outcomes
- EAU 2025: Consider only in clinical trials or specialized centers

## Active Surveillance

**What it is:**
Close monitoring without immediate treatment for low-risk prostate cancer.

**When it's recommended:**
- Low-risk disease (Gleason 3+3, PSA <10, ≤2 cores involved)
- Patient preference for observation
- Avoids overtreatment of slow-growing cancers

**What to expect:**
- PSA blood tests: Every 3-6 months
- DRE (digital rectal exam): Annually
- Repeat MRI: Every 1-2 years
- Repeat biopsy: If PSA rises or imaging changes
- Treatment if progression detected

**Recovery:**
- No recovery needed - non-invasive
- Ongoing monitoring indefinitely
- Can switch to treatment at any time if needed

**Important notes:**
- 30-40% will eventually need treatment
- Excellent outcomes for truly low-risk disease
- Requires patient commitment to follow-up
- Reduces unnecessary surgery/radiation

**Evidence:**
- NICE NG131: Recommended for CPG1 (low-risk)
- EAU 2025: Standard approach for favorable-risk disease
- Multiple RCTs show excellent long-term outcomes

## Radical Prostatectomy (Surgery)

**What it is:**
Surgical removal of the entire prostate gland and seminal vesicles.

**When it's recommended:**
- Intermediate to high-risk localized cancer
- Patient age <70 with good health
- Definitive treatment goal
- Failed radiation therapy

**What to expect:**
- Hospital admission: 1-2 days
- Surgery time: 2-3 hours
- General anesthesia
- Robotic or open approach

**Recovery:**
- Hospital discharge: 1-2 days
- Return to light activities: 2-3 weeks
- Full recovery: 6-8 weeks
- Catheter: 1-2 weeks
- Urinary continence: Improves over 3-6 months

**Side effects:**
- Urinary incontinence: 5-20% long-term
- Erectile dysfunction: 30-50% (depends on nerve preservation)
- Bowel changes: Rare

**Evidence:**
- EAU 2025: Gold standard for intermediate-high risk
- Excellent long-term cancer control (>90% at 10 years)
- Best outcomes in high-volume centers

---

## Radiation Therapy

**What it is:**
High-energy X-rays targeting cancer cells in the prostate.

**Types:**
- External Beam Radiation (EBRT): 7-9 weeks, daily treatments
- Brachytherapy: Radioactive seeds implanted in prostate

**When it's recommended:**
- Intermediate to high-risk disease
- Patients >70 or with comorbidities
- Localized cancer without distant spread
- Recurrence after surgery

**Recovery:**
- Outpatient treatment
- Fatigue: Common during treatment
- Urinary/bowel symptoms: Temporary, resolve in weeks
- Return to normal: During or shortly after treatment

**Side effects:**
- Urinary symptoms: 20-30%
- Bowel symptoms: 10-20%
- Erectile dysfunction: 30-40%

**Evidence:**
- EAU 2025: Equivalent to surgery for localized disease
- Excellent long-term outcomes (>85% at 10 years)
- Better functional outcomes than surgery in some studies

## Decision-Making Framework

**For Low-Risk Disease:**
1. Active Surveillance (preferred if compliant)
2. HIFU (if available, patient preference)
3. Surgery/Radiation (if patient wants definitive treatment)

**For Intermediate-Risk Disease:**
1. Surgery (if age <70, good health)
2. Radiation (if age >70 or comorbidities)
3. HIFU (if available, patient preference, MRI concordance)

**For High-Risk Disease:**
1. Surgery + Radiation (multimodal)
2. Radiation + Hormone therapy
3. Referral to oncology for systemic therapy

## Key Patient Questions to Address

- "What's my risk group?" (Low/Intermediate/High based on Gleason, PSA, staging)
- "Do I need treatment now?" (Depends on risk and patient preference)
- "What are the side effects?" (Varies by procedure)
- "How long is recovery?" (1-2 days to 6-8 weeks depending on procedure)
- "What if I change my mind?" (Can switch from AS to treatment; surgery is definitive)
- "What's the success rate?" (>90% cancer control for localized disease)
